## Realife Opening — Two Children in the Same Classroom

In a single classroom, you might find two extremes.  
One child is restless, mischievous, always stirring trouble. Another sits quietly, shy but diligent, never causing problems. Both were once newborns — innocent, without labels of “good” or “bad.” Yet as they grow, their personalities diverge.  

Where does this difference come from? Is it written in their genes, shaped by the environment, or carved by the experiences and upbringing they receive?

## The Roots of Personality: Three Forces at Play

### 1. Genetics — The Biological Blueprint  

Research suggests that temperament has a genetic basis. Some children are naturally more impulsive, others more cautious. Genes provide predispositions — like seeds that may grow under the right (or wrong) conditions.  

### 2. Environment — The Social Soil  

Family, peers, culture, and community act as the soil in which those seeds grow. A child raised in a nurturing, structured environment may develop discipline, while one surrounded by chaos or neglect may lean toward disruptive behavior.  

### 3. Experience and Upbringing — The Daily Watering  

Experiences — from parenting styles to friendships — shape how traits are expressed. A strict upbringing may suppress certain impulses, while supportive guidance can channel energy into positive outlets. Over time, repeated experiences become habits, and habits crystallize into personality.

## Everyday Examples

- **At School**: The “troublemaker” who disrupts class may be acting out unmet needs or imitating peers. The “good student” may thrive because of encouragement at home or a natural inclination toward order.  
- **In Relationships**: A “naughty” partner who is harsh, crude, or unfaithful may reflect both personal impulses and learned patterns from past environments. Meanwhile, a “good” partner who is gentle and calm may have internalized empathy and respect from upbringing.  
- **Peer Influence**: Studies show that individuals often adopt behaviors of their social group. A person may not start out “bad,” but repeated exposure to negative influences can normalize destructive habits.

## Research Insight — The Case of Identical Twins

Studies on **identical twins** provide some of the clearest insights into the origins of personality. Since they share nearly identical DNA, differences between them often highlight the role of environment and experience.  

- **University of Oslo Study**: Researchers followed 53 pairs of twins (35 identical) from infancy to age 29. They found that **roughly half of personality is influenced by genetics, and the other half by environment and life experiences**. For example, twins exposed to different levels of stress developed noticeably different traits.  

- **Separated Twins Case**: In one famous case, identical twins from South Korea were raised in two different countries. Despite similarities in mental health and life satisfaction, they showed significant differences in IQ and thinking styles. This demonstrates how **environment can shape development in dramatically different ways, even with the same genetic foundation**.

## The Possibility of Change

The most important truth: **personality is not fixed.**  
- A mischievous child can grow into a responsible adult with the right guidance.  
- A shy, quiet child can develop confidence through supportive experiences.  
- Even adults can unlearn toxic patterns and cultivate healthier ones.  

This reflects the concept of *neuroplasticity* — the brain’s ability to adapt and rewire itself through new experiences.

## Philosophical Reflection

At birth, every human is like a blank page. Genes provide the paper’s texture, environment provides the ink, and experiences write the story. But unlike a finished book, the story of personality is always open to revision.  

> *“We are not prisoners of our nature, nor mere products of our nurture — we are authors rewriting ourselves with every choice we make.”*

---

## Closing Reflection

So, are “naughty” and “good” traits inherited, shaped, or taught? The answer is: all of them, intertwined. Genes set the stage, environment directs the play, and experiences write the script.  

What matters most is not where we begin, but how we continue. Because in the end, every person carries the possibility of change — to turn mischief into creativity, or quietness into strength.
