## Opening — The Jungle of Faces

Imagine walking through a crowded hallway at school. Friends laugh with you in class, but outside the gates, they barely remember your name. In the workplace, colleagues smile, but behind the smile lies calculation: who is an ally, who is a rival, who is useful. Life, in many ways, resembles a jungle — survival often demands strategy, and sincerity is not always the first instinct.  
it is the environment that forces them to adapt and pretend.

## The Nature of Conditional Care

Humans are social beings, but our care for others is rarely unconditional. Most interactions are shaped by:  
- **Context** — friendships that exist only within school, office, or community boundaries.  
- **Utility** — people who approach when they need something, then disappear.  
- **Competition** — empathy that fades when personal interests are threatened.  
- **Social masks** — politeness or “fake empathy” to maintain appearances, not genuine concern.  

This does not always mean people are cruel — it means they are navigating a world where survival, recognition, and self-interest often come first.

## Scientific Perspective — Insights from Social Psychology

Social psychology explains that human interaction is deeply influenced by **reciprocity** (the expectation of return), **impression management** (the desire to look good in front of others), and **social identity** (the tendency to favor those in our group).  

- **Reciprocity**: People often show care because they expect it will be returned later.  
- **Impression Management**: Acts of kindness are sometimes performed to maintain a positive image, not purely from empathy.  
- **In-group Bias**: We tend to care more about those who belong to our group (friends, colleagues, family) and show indifference to strangers.  

Research also shows that **egoism** can be a form of *self-preservation*. People may act selfishly not only to exploit others, but also to protect themselves from emotional harm or resource loss. Egoism, in this sense, is both a shield and a weapon.

## Examples in Everyday Life

- **School Friendships**: A classmate who seems close, but once graduation comes, the bond vanishes.  
- **Workplace Dynamics**: A colleague who praises your work, but only to secure your support for their project.  
- **Competition**: A peer who shows empathy when you struggle, but secretly feels relieved because it reduces their competition.  
- **Social Media Empathy**: People who post condolences or support online, but never reach out privately — empathy as performance.  
- **Indifference to Strangers**: On the street, many passersby ignore someone who falls or struggles, assuming “someone else will help.” This is known as the *bystander effect*.

## Fictional Narrative — The Fall on the Street

It was a rainy evening. A man slipped on the wet pavement, his groceries scattering across the road. Dozens of people passed by — some glanced, some frowned, most looked away. Each had their own reasons: too busy, too cautious, too indifferent.  

Minutes passed before a young woman finally stopped. She knelt, gathered the bruised apples, and offered her umbrella. She didn’t ask for thanks, didn’t post it online, didn’t expect anything in return.  

For the man, that single act of genuine care shone brighter than the indifference of the dozens who walked past. In a world where most care is conditional, even one sincere gesture can feel like salvation.

## Philosophical Reflection

This reality may sound harsh, but it is not purely negative. Conditional care is part of the human condition. In a sense, it is **transactional empathy** — a way people balance self-preservation with social harmony.  

The philosopher Thomas Hobbes once described human life as a struggle in the “state of nature,” where survival instincts dominate. Modern society softens this struggle, but the echoes remain: people often care when there is a reason, when it aligns with their interests, or when it reinforces their identity.  

Yet, within this jungle, genuine bonds still exist. They are rare, but precisely because they are rare, they are precious.

## Closing Reflection

> *“Not all care is pure, not all empathy is sincere. But in the wilderness of human interaction, even a single genuine bond is enough to remind us that sincerity still exists.”*
