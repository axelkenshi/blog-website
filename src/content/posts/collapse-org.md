## Opening Scene — Watching an Organization Breathe

I once sat in the back of a crowded hall, watching a newly formed student organization hold its very first meeting. The energy was electric — ideas flying, hands raised, laughter filling the air. It felt like watching something come alive.  

Years later, I returned to the same hall. The chairs were half-empty, the discussions sluggish, and the once-vibrant banner had faded. The organization still existed, but its heartbeat was weak. Not long after, it quietly dissolved.  

That experience made me realise: organizations are not static. They are born, they fight to survive, and sometimes, they collapse.

## The Life Cycle of an Organization

1. **Birth** — Formed from an idea, vision, or shared purpose.  
2. **Growth** — Energy is high, members are motivated, and goals are pursued with passion.  
3. **Maturity** — Systems, rules, and traditions stabilize the organization.  
4. **Decline** — Stagnation, internal conflict, or failure to adapt begins to weaken it.  
5. **Collapse or Renewal** — The organization either reinvents itself or fades away.

## What Keeps an Organization Alive

- **Leadership Rotation** — Fresh leaders bring new energy while respecting the foundation.  
- **Adaptability** — Adjusting to changes in environment, culture, or technology.  
- **Shared Vision** — Members must feel connected to a purpose larger than themselves.  
- **Healthy Culture** — Trust, transparency, and collaboration sustain momentum.  

---

## Why Organizations Collapse

- **Internal Conflict** — Power struggles or lack of unity erode trust.  
- **Rigid Structures** — Inability to adapt to new challenges or generations.  
- **Loss of Purpose** — When members forget *why* the organization exists.  
- **Overdependence on Individuals** — If one leader leaves, the whole system crumbles.

## Real-Life Example — Student Councils and Community Groups

Many student councils in schools or universities start with passion. In the first years, members are eager to prove themselves, organize events, and leave a legacy. But as time passes, challenges emerge:  
- Some leaders treat positions as titles, not responsibilities.  
- Successors inherit structures but not the same spirit.  
- Without renewal, the organization becomes a formality — existing in name but not in impact.  

Similarly, community groups often rise during crises (like disaster relief or social movements). They thrive on urgency and solidarity. But once the crisis fades, so does the commitment, unless the group evolves into a sustainable structure.

## Big-Scale Examples — Giants That Fell

History shows us that even the largest corporations can collapse if they fail to adapt:  

- **Kodak** — Once the king of photography, controlling 85% of the global film market in the 1990s. Ironically, Kodak invented the first digital camera but shelved it, fearing it would hurt their film business. When smartphones with cameras took over, Kodak was left behind and eventually filed for bankruptcy.  

- **Blockbuster** — At its peak, Blockbuster had over 9,000 video rental stores worldwide. But when streaming technology emerged, they clung to their old model. They even had the chance to buy Netflix in the early 2000s — and declined. Within a decade, Blockbuster was gone, while Netflix became a global giant.  

- **BlackBerry** — Once the ultimate smartphone for professionals, even used by world leaders. But they underestimated the touchscreen revolution brought by Apple and Android. Their refusal to adapt quickly enough turned them from market leader to near irrelevance.  

These stories show that collapse isn’t about size — it’s about adaptability. The bigger the organization, the harder it can be to change direction, but the cost of standing still is even greater.

## Closing Reflection

> *“An organization is not just built by its founders — it is sustained by every generation that chooses to keep its purpose alive.”*

From student councils to global corporations, the lesson is the same: survival is never guaranteed. The real challenge is not just to build, but to adapt, to renew, and to remember the purpose that gave birth to the organization in the first place.
