## 1. Introduction: What Is a Cognitive Bias?

A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from rational judgment. Our brains rely on “shortcuts” (heuristics) to process information quickly. While heuristics improve efficiency, they often lead to errors in judgment—especially when making important decisions.

## 2. Why Do Biases Occur?

- Brains seek to conserve mental energy by using shortcuts.  
- In urgent situations, a rapid response often trumps perfect accuracy.  
- Emotional needs—like feeling safe or confident—can push us to ignore threatening data.

---

## 3. Categories of Cognitive Bias

### 3.1 Heuristic Biases

- Anchoring: Overreliance on an initial piece of information (number, example).  
- Availability: Judging likelihood by how easily instances come to mind.  
- Representativeness: Classifying based on stereotypes rather than statistical data.

### 3.2 Social and Perception Biases

- Halo Effect: Letting one positive trait overshadow other assessments.  
- In-group Bias: Favoring members of our group and undervaluing outsiders.  
- Fundamental Attribution Error: Attributing someone’s actions to character, not circumstances.

### 3.3 Memory and Hindsight Biases

- Hindsight Bias: Believing “I knew it all along” after an event occurs.  
- Recency Bias: Weighing recent information more heavily.  
- Primacy Effect: Clinging to first impressions.

### 3.4 Biases in Decision Making

- Confirmation Bias: Seeking or interpreting information that supports existing beliefs.  
- Overconfidence: Excessive faith in our predictions or abilities.  
- Loss Aversion: Preferring to avoid losses rather than acquire equivalent gains.  
- Sunk Cost Fallacy: Continuing an endeavor because of past investments, despite poor outlook.  
- Status Quo Bias: Preferring current conditions over potentially better alternatives.  
- Planning Fallacy: Underestimating time and resources needed for a task.  
- Gambler’s Fallacy: Expecting random events to “even out” in the short run.

## 7. Conclusion

Cognitive biases are inseparable from human thought. By identifying biases—from simple heuristics to complex social patterns—we can build mitigation strategies and make more objective decisions. Quality decisions stem from awareness, structure, and a commitment to continuous learning.
