- **Liability**: An obligation to transfer economic value—debts, loans, accounts payable—that must be settled through assets or services.  

- **Equity**: The residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities; in a corporation, it represents shareholders’ ownership stake.  

- **Cash Flow**: The net amount of cash moving into and out of a business during a period. Positive cash flow fuels operations, investments, and debt repayment.

- **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Indicates how much cash is available to investors or for debt service.  

- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) × 100%. A basic metric for assessing profitability relative to invested capital.  

- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Net Income / Shareholders’ Equity. Measures how effectively a company uses equity to generate profit.  

- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: The sum of discounted future cash flows minus initial investment. A positive NPV signals a value-adding project.  

- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: The discount rate that makes an NPV equal to zero. Reflects a project’s expected annualized return.  

- **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**: A blended rate of debt and equity financing costs, weighted by their proportions in the capital structure.

- **Mutual Fund**: A pooled investment vehicle managed by professionals, offering diversification across stocks, bonds, or other assets.  

- **Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)**: A basket of securities trading like a single stock on an exchange, often tracking an index at low fees.
