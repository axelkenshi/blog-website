## 🍁 Introduction: A Fleeting Utopia  

The digital world today often feels like paradise. Everything is at our fingertips: entertainment, information, communication, even an escape from reality. Yet behind this ease lies a paradox: the happiness offered is fleeting, while addiction and attachment can blur the meaning of real life.

## 🧠 A Fleeting Utopia  

Though it feels like paradise, digital happiness is often temporary.  

- **Addiction:** Endless scrolling, binge-watching, or excessive gaming drains energy.  
- **Emptiness:** Once the screen is off, a hollow feeling often returns.  
- **Distorted reality:** Digital immersion can make us forget that real life needs attention.  
- **Shallow ties:** Online relationships may lack the depth of face-to-face interactions.
