## A slap of reality to the idealist

There are moments in life when the boundary between impossible and possible feels blurred. I still remember one morning at school, during a discussion about the future. The teacher asked us: *“What do you imagine yourself to be years from now?”*  

While most of my classmates stayed silent, I answered spontaneously: *“I want to be a multi-sector entrepreneur.”* The words came out naturally, as if they reflected a vision I had long carried within me. But my teacher quickly challenged me. He reminded me that the future is uncertain, that no one truly knows how ambitions will unfold. Even with strong determination and vivid imagination, reality may not align with our *desires*. His advice was clear: have a more mature plan, and always prepare a **plan B** in case destiny takes a turn away from our expectations.  

At that moment, his words felt painful, almost dismissive of my dream. Yet, over time, I realized they carried a broader truth. The statement was not meant to crush ambition, but to widen perspective. Yes, the future is unpredictable. Yes, it is a very abstract thing for now. Yes, dreams can be fragile. But that does not mean we must accept impossibility as absolute.

## 🌌 Between Impossible and Possible  

Dreams often begin as fragile visions, easily doubted by others. To some, they appear impossible — too ambitious, too unrealistic. Yet history shows that impossibility is often only a temporary label, one that fades when persistence, creativity, and resilience are applied.  

My teacher’s reminder about uncertainty was valid: no one can guarantee outcomes. But impossibility is not a verdict; it is a challenge. The journey toward ambition requires both courage to pursue the vision and humility to adapt when reality shifts.

## 🔄 The Importance of Plan B  

The advice about **plan B** became a turning point in my reflection. A plan B is not a betrayal of ambition, but a safeguard against despair. It allows us to keep moving forward even when the original path becomes blocked. In fact, many successful journeys are shaped not by the first plan, but by the adjustments made along the way.  

Ambition without flexibility can lead to frustration. But ambition with resilience — the willingness to pivot, to learn, to reframe — transforms impossibility into possibility.

## 🌱 Expanding Positive Probabilities  

If I want to increase the chances of a meaningful future, there are steps I can take right now:  

- **Build small, consistent habits**: reading, writing ideas, practicing skills, and maintaining mental and physical health.  
- **Expand networks and experiences**: join communities, discussions, or projects that open new perspectives.  
- **Train adaptability**: learn to accept change and adjust strategies without losing sight of the vision.  
- **Set short-term milestones**: small achievements serve as proof that the journey is still moving forward.

## 🛤️ Keeping the Route from Branching or Ending  

Dreams are often disrupted by distractions, ego, or the desire for quick success. To keep the route intact:  

- **Hold on to personal values as a compass**: principles guide decisions and prevent us from drifting aimlessly.  
- **Evaluate regularly**: review progress and make corrections before straying too far.  
- **Avoid the trap of ego**: focus on meaning and growth, not just recognition.  
- **Strengthen mental endurance**: resilience ensures we stay on course even when obstacles feel overwhelming.

## ⛵ Final Reflection  

The journey toward dreams is rarely beautiful at the beginning. Sometimes it feels disappointing, sometimes far from what we imagined. Yet, with time, experience sharpens direction, and the seeds of vision we plant can grow into reality.  

Impossible and possible are not two separate worlds, but two sides of the same journey. What determines the outcome is not only the dream itself, but how we walk the path — with discipline, adaptability, and resilience.  

> *“A vision’s seed does not grow from ego, but from patience and a guarded direction.”*

## 🌟 Advice for the Next Generation  

We must learn from those who have succeeded: not by copying their results, but by adopting their mentality. Resilience, networks, discipline, and long-term vision are foundations we can plant today. With them, we not only build our own future, but also prepare the way for the generations to come.  

> *“Let us be the generation that plants seeds of vision with patience, so our children may harvest opportunity.”*
