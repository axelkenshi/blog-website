# A letter of Mindset

Whatever you do in this world will have a consequence that will come in any way, whether good or bad karma.
What you sow, that is what you reap.  
We don't know and will never know who truly appreciates and admires our work.  
Holding authority means carrying responsibility, not arbitrary powers.  
mental conditions and thought patterns influence a person's actions.  
give up on the first challenge, that's a loser.  
Good communication, able to convey the right meaning.  
respect others first, then they will respect you later.  
charisma or being respected by people, begins with self-confidence and interaction style.  

What is done without intention will feel bland, but what is done wholeheartedly will feel satisfying.  
Gaining knowledge is difficult and requires intention, but the hardest thing is retaining it in the deepest memory.  
Maintaining wealth is not as easy as getting it.  
Sharing knowledge and experience is not wrong, as a form of charity and goodness, it is good for them to know that, who change their lives.  
Greedy nature appears when people are faced with tempting profits.  
There is no such thing as a wasted effort, everything is a stepping stone to something better.  
Hanging out with mediocrity will make you mediocre, hanging out with ambitious will make you ambitious.  

Being too ambitious can be dangerous because it can lead to cognitive bias.  
Be serious about the field you are pursuing, focus on what you are doing, then serious success will come.  
If you don't sacrifice for what you want, then you desires will be sacrificed.  
Intelligence performance is not determined at birth, but during growth and development.  
Expecting something to change without trying is very impossible.  

Skills can be mastered with 3 conditions: desire, belief, perseverance.  
To get used to a skill, it takes repetition.  
To find out where the mistakes are in every struggle, a mentor is needed.  
Some people are indifferent when they don't need you, but care when they do.  
Everyone can teach but not everyone can educate.  
A person who has determination during his life, after his death will not be in vain.

If not now, then when? If not you, then who?
