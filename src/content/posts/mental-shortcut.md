# Introduction, The Hook: A Familiar Scroll  

You wake up. You unlock your phone.  
Two headlines flash. Three messages ping.  
You open Instagram, then TikTok, then maybe Threads. Somewhere between sips of coffee, you’ve “seen enough.”  

But pause—are you *thinking*? Or are you *reacting*?  
Welcome to the age of cognitive autopilot.

## Shortcuts in Our Minds (a.k.a. Heuristics)  

The human brain loves saving energy. So it builds shortcuts—called *heuristics*—to avoid thinking from scratch every time.

Here are a few classics:

- **Availability bias** — If something comes to mind easily (like a viral video), we think it’s more common or true.  
- **Confirmation bias** — We favor info that fits what we already believe.  
- **Anchoring** — The first number or headline we see becomes our “mental baseline.”  

These shortcuts are fast. Sometimes even helpful.  
But pair them with a flood of notifications, headlines, and content...  
Now we have a problem: **overstimulated brains making undercooked conclusions.**

## The Digital Brain Drain  

Let’s face it:  
We process more information before lunch than our grandparents saw in a week.

And that leads to:

- **Cognitive fatigue** — Our brains conserve effort by accepting the first “good enough” answer.  
- **Decision overload** — So many options, so we let the feed or algorithm decide.  
- **Reaction loops** — Anger emoji > share > quote tweet > forget > scroll again.

> The end result? Less curiosity. More certainty.  
> Less asking “What do I think?” and more “What do people like me say?”

## A 10-Minute Cognitive Audit  

Try this quick personal challenge:

🧠 Think of **3 strong opinions** you’ve shared online recently.

For each one, ask:

1. *Where did I first hear this?*  
2. *Did I verify it—or just nod along?*  
3. *What would the opposing viewpoint say?*

**Reflection, not judgment.**  
You may realize some opinions weren't chosen—they were *absorbed*.

## Are We Outsourcing Thought?

Spotify curates your vibe.  
Netflix predicts your night.  
Google finishes your sentence.  
Instagram *knows* what color palette you’ll like next.

Little by little, we're letting algorithms think *for* us—by telling us what to see, click, buy, and care about.

They're optimized for **clicks**, not **clarity**.

## So… Are We Still Thinking?

Yes. But we're running on autopilot more often than we realize.  
And like any habit, it becomes comfortable.

What if we:

- Delayed reactions by 15 seconds?  
- Asked, “Who profits if I believe this?”  
- Paused before reposting outrage or retweeting certainty?

Maybe thinking *is* the new rebellion.
