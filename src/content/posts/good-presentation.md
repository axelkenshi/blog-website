## From Nervous Starter to Confident Storyteller

> *“I stood at the front of the room. I had memorized the material. But my tongue… froze. The words were trapped, and time seemed to stop.”*

Many people know this moment: a tight chest, a blank mind, cold hands. Not because they weren’t prepared, but because their energy and focus weren’t yet channeled.  
The good news? That nervousness can be turned into *fuel* to perform stronger than most.  
The essence of a good presentation starts from the delivery method and interaction style that we determine.

## 1. The Journey: From Nervous to Owning the Room

**Early Stage**  
- Slides packed with text, voice too soft, eyes down.  
- Focused on “don’t make a mistake” instead of “what do they need to know.”  
- Result: the audience listens, but they’re not connected.

**Experienced Stage**  
- Simple material, clear main points.  
- Eye contact across the room, voice with rhythm.  
- Result: the audience is *inside* the story, not just hearing it.

## 2. Core Principles That Set You Apart

💡 **Easy to remember with the 3C Formula: Clear – Connected – Controlled**

1. **Clear**  
   - One main idea + 3 supporting points.  
   - Avoid jargon unless explained instantly with an analogy.
  :::tip
  ***Jargon*** is an special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand.
  :::

2. **Connected**  
   - Start with a hook (story, question, surprising fact).  
   - Use examples that match the audience’s world.

3. **Controlled**  
   - Use pauses to emphasize key points.  
   - Don’t fear silence; it often draws people in.

## 3. Techniques You Can Use Tomorrow

| Situation                    | Quick Technique                              | Why It Works |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| First 30 seconds             | Memorize word-for-word                        | Signals confidence right away |
| Forgetting a point           | Breathe, pause, repeat the last point         | Gives your brain time to reset |
| Audience losing focus        | Ask “Who here has ever…?”                     | Re-engages without pressure |
| Explaining a complex concept | Use a visual analogy                          | Images stick in memory |

## 4. 15‑Minute Practice Drill That Changes Everything

1. **Bullet Point Breakdown**  
   Write your material as short bullets, not a script.  
2. **Story Injection**  
   Add 1 story/analogy for each big point.  
3. **Mirror Talk**  
   Practice in front of a mirror while keeping eye contact.  
4. **Phone Record**  
   Record → play back → note filler words like “um” or “so.”

## 5. Memory Hook: “E.S.A.”

To make your presentation *stickier*, prep it with **E.S.A.**:

- **E**ntertain → Start with something captivating (story, humor, unique fact)  
- **S**implify → Boil down to the essentials + supportive visuals  
- **A**ctivate → Involve the audience with an interaction or short reflection

This pattern makes it easier for the audience to remember — and apply — your ideas later.

## 6. A Closing That Locks In the Message

> “A great presentation isn’t the one that makes you look smart, but the one that makes the audience feel smart.”

Success isn’t about whether you’re nervous or not — it’s about how you turn that nervous energy into connection, focus, and the right flow. Every time you stand in front of people, you’re not just speaking. You are **directing the room’s attention and emotion**.  
I've gotten rid of the mindset of "I can't and I'm not ready." After all, introverts just tend to not like wasting energy, while shy people tend to get nervous easily, once they understand the patterns and techniques, even though it's mentally draining, it's a experience to growth.
