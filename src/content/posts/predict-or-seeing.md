## Introduction — A Glimpse of the Future

Imagine one day you were given the ability to see or predict your own future. Whether through dreams, intuition, or logical calculations from life experience, you see a clear image: an event that will happen. The question is: can we change it, or are we destined to witness it unfold, even if by different paths?

## Prediction vs Control

- **Prediction** arises from experience, patterns, and insight. We often sense where life is heading based on the choices we make.  
- **Control** is something else entirely. Even if we know what might happen, not everything is within our grasp. External factors, other people, and unexpected events can still lead us to the same outcome.  

It is as if the future is a great river: we may choose small channels within it, but the current still carries us to the same sea.

## Fate That Can Be Changed, Fate That Cannot

- **What can be changed**: habits, daily choices, attitudes toward challenges.  
- **What is difficult to change**: major events shaped by forces beyond us — illness, disasters, or the decisions of others.  

In other words, only a small part of fate can be altered. The rest is something we must accept, however bitter it may be.

## Andry’s Story: A Shadow That Could Not Be Escaped

Andry was a young man who one night dreamed vividly: he saw himself ten years in the future, sitting in a wheelchair, frail, surrounded by medical equipment.  

From that day, Andry lived in dilemma.  

- **If he accepted the vision as fate**, then every step would feel like a march toward a terrifying certainty.  
- **If he resisted**, he would have to change his lifestyle, avoid risks, and fight hard to prevent it.  

Andry chose to resist. He began exercising, eating better, and abandoning bad habits. Yet the vision haunted him. Every time he felt tired or sick, he remembered the wheelchair.  

Until one day, he realized: perhaps the future is not something to be fully avoided, but a **mirror of the choices we make today**. The wheelchair might be a warning, not a sentence.  

Andry made peace. He continued to care for his health, but no longer lived in fear. He chose to **live each day with meaning**, instead of running from shadows.

## Short-Term Predictions: Intuition and Logic

Imagine someone walking home from work. The sky is heavy with clouds, the air damp, the wind stronger than usual. From years of experience, they predict: *“It’s going to rain soon.”*  

They decide to wait at a bus stop instead of walking. That small choice saves them from being drenched, or worse, slipping on wet roads and getting into an accident.  

This shows that **short-term predictions** — born of intuition and logical calculation — can change outcomes. Yet even then, factors remain beyond control: the rain may be heavier than expected, or it may stop sooner.

## Nico’s Story: Changing a Broken Future

Nico, a twenty-year-old, once dreamed of a glimpse of his future: a life in ruins, unstable work, and himself trapped in meaningless circles of friends.  

He woke with fear and realization — that his youth was being wasted on empty pleasures, without direction.  

That dream became a turning point. Nico decided to change course: he distanced himself from harmful company, built discipline, and pursued the career he had long imagined. The journey was not easy — full of rejection, failure, and doubt. But with firm commitment, he slowly saw his future shift: from a bleak shadow to a brighter path.  

Nico’s story shows that **a vision of the future is not a verdict**, but a warning. With awareness and determination, one can change direction.

## Rina’s Story: An Investment That Paid Off

Rina was a young analyst who loved studying market patterns. He didn’t have much capital, but he had **discipline, intuition sharpened by experience, and logical reasoning**.  

One day, he noticed an investment instrument that most people ignored. Based on historical data, careful analysis, and a “gut feeling” honed by years of observation, Rina decided to put part of his savings into it.  

At first, the results were modest. But years later, the value of that investment multiplied many times over. What began as a small, almost uncertain decision turned into a life-changing gain.  

Rina’s story shows that **the future is not always revealed in grand visions or mystical prophecies**. Sometimes, it is hidden in the small decisions we make with intuition, logic, and patience.

## Philosophical Reflection

Perhaps the ability to see the future is not about avoiding fate, but about **learning to make peace with it**. If we know something is coming, we can:  

- Prepare ourselves mentally and emotionally.  
- Change how we respond, even if the outcome is the same.  
- Find meaning in the journey, not just the result.  

> *“The future may not be fully ours to change, but how we face it is a freedom we always possess.”*  

---

## Conclusion

Seeing the future is not about escaping suffering or securing certainty, but about **finding wisdom in acceptance, and courage in changing what can be changed**.  

> *“Perhaps we cannot avoid fate, but we can choose how we meet it.”*  

What you see in your mind and what you do now actually has a direct impact on your future.  

Never try to view it as trivial, as if your life is controlled by a "system" of cause and effect.
Consider it a reflection of your life's "steering wheel."
